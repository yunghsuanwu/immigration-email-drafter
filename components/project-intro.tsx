          <ul className="list-disc list-outside space-y-2 mb-4 ml-4 pl-4">
            <li>The skill threshold for Skilled Worker visas is now raised, and 111 eligible occupations are now removed;</li>
            <li>The social care worker visa route to overseas recruitment is now closed;</li>
            <li>
              There is only time-limited access below degree level through a targeted immigration salary list 
              and temporary shortage list, for critical roles only, with strict requirements for sectors to 
              grow domestic skills;
            </li>
            <li>The Commission the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) is to conduct a review of the temporary shortage list including occupations, salaries and benefits.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          We're currently working with experts to provide a detailed summary on what these changes may mean for different stakeholders, including visa holders, those with indefinite leave to remain/settled status, employers, and beyond.

          In the meantime, we encourage you to check out some resources that other migrant advisory bodies and migrants rights groups have already compiled:
