# Immigration Email Drafter

On 22 July 2025, new UK immigration rules restrict visa thresholds and holder conditions. The [Immigration Email Drafter](http://bit.ly/4lwBJ19) is an AI email drafting tool helping affected individuals tell policymakers how these changes impact them, expressing their concerns in their own language and voice. Tell your MP your story now. **Tell them you are not a stranger.**

The design is a simple LLM-wraper: A user fills in a form that asks relevant and personal questions, finds their own MP, and sends all the data to an LLM (currently OpenAIâ€™s gpt-4o) to draft a personalized email for them to send to their MP.

The form asks slightly different questions, depending on why the user is writing the email.

In this repository, you could find the prompt used for the LLM.

# About Not A Stranger
Not A Stranger ([notastranger.org](https://notastranger.org/)) is a migrant-led initiative by young civic technologists building their lives in the UK. It was created in response to the government's 2025 white paper on immigration, which includes sweeping changes to the path to citizenship and further restrictions on migrants' rights. In the face of growing anti-immigrant rhetoric, we're developing digital tools that empower migrants not only to be heard -- but to shape the policies that affect our communities.

This tool is developed by Yung-Hsuan under the Not A Stranger initiative. Contact him at A@B where A = yung-hsuan.wu and B = notastranger.org .
